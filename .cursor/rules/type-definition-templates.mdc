- Purpose: Files located in `packages/templates/templates/*` are EJS-backed templates that generate TypeScript declaration files.
- Treat content as EJS + ambient TypeScript (declaration context).
- Preserve all EJS tags and variables (`<% %>`, `<%= %>`, `<%- %>`); do not refactor or reformat inside tags.
- Conditional/partial output is expected; unresolved identifiers/placeholders may appear in templates.
- Ignore ESLint/TypeScript errors within templates. Do NOT add imports, stubs, or rename symbols just to satisfy lints—they resolve in the generated output.
- Prefer declaration/ambient syntax; avoid adding runtime code.
- Keep template logic minimal and deterministic; use simple EJS conditions/loops.
- Favor clarity and stable whitespace/indentation so generated diffs remain minimal.
